          warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Plooh, including all implied

        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of us and any of our suppliers under
          any provision of this agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
          amount actually paid by you for the use of any Plooh application. To the maximum extent permitted by
          applicable law, in no event shallwe or our suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or
          consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data
          or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in
          any way related to the use of or inability to use Plooh, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used
          with Plooh, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this agreement), even if we or any supplier has
          been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some
          states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the
          above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and
          interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
          law and the remaining provisions will continuein full force and effect. This agreement, in coalition with the
          Privacy Policy and any otherlegal notices published by Plooh LLC, shall constitute the entire agreement
          between you and us concerning the use of Plooh. If any provision of this agreement is deemed invalid by a
          court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
          remaining provisions of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of
          this agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure
          to assert any right orprovision under this agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <p>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS: YOU AND US AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO Plooh MUST
          COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY
          BARRED.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of anobligation under
          this agreement shall not affect a party&#x27;s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
          any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure to
          exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under this agreement
          shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or
          power under this agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event
          of a conflict between this agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this agreement
          shall govern.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>The agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of Plooh and supersedes
          all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and us. You may be subject to additional
          terms and conditions that apply when you use or purchase other services from us, which we will provide to you
          at the time of such use or purchase.</p>
        <h2><br /><br />Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Plooh and their entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information,
          software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are
          owned by us, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by and international
          copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. The
          material may not be copied, modified, reproduced, downloaded or distributed in any way, in whole or in part,
          without the express prior written permission of us, unless and except as is expressly provided in these Terms
          &amp; Conditions. Any unauthorized use of the material is prohibited.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
        <p>This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOESN&#x27;T INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO CLAIMS FOR
          INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR OR Plooh LLC&#x27;s INTELLECTUAL
          PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term &quot;dispute&quot; means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and
          us concerning Plooh or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or
          any other legal or equitable basis. &quot;Dispute&quot; will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable
          under law.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Notice of Dispute</h2>
        <p>In the event of a dispute, you or us must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement
          that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to
          the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send anyNotice of Dispute via email. We will send any Notice
          of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address if we have it. You
          and us will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date
          the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or us may commence arbitration.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Binding Arbitration</h2>
        <p>If you and us don&#x27;t resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute
          will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right
          to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. The
          dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
          American Arbitration Association. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any
          court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party&#x27;s rights or property pending the
          completion of arbitration. Any and all legal, accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the
          prevailing party shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.</p>

          advertisements, data or proposals, including ideas for new or improved products, services, features,
          technologies or promotions, you expressly agree that such submissions will automatically be treated as
          non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the sole property of us without any compensation or
          credit to you whatsoever. We and our affiliates shall have no obligations with respect to such submissions or
          posts and may use the ideas contained in such submissions or posts forany purposes in any medium in

          using such ideas.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <h2>Promotions</h2>
